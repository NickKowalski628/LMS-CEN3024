This program was developed for a library to manage patrons that they serve in the library. With this application its users can load patron data from a textfile and store it to an arraylist. This console-based application primarily operates with an onscreen menu that allows users to choose between four primary functions as well as an option to exit. These fucntions are load data from a file, manually add and remove patrons, and display all users within the current list.
